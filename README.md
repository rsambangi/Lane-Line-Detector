# Lane-Line-Detector

A lane line detection algorithm made with C++ and OpenCV with 94% accuracy on a 1000-image dataset and implemented in the SAE AutoDrive Challenge II for autonomous lane changes. The algorithm is able to differentiate between dashed, solid, white, and yellow lane lines along with detecting limit lines for intersections.

# How It Works

* Image Preprocessing
*   sdfsfsd

# What I Learned

* Hough Line Transform application and region of interest (ROI) masking to reduce the computational load
* OpenCV image processing techniques (Color Masks, Gaussian Blur, Canny Edge Detection, etc.)
* ROS Node Programming

# Test Images
